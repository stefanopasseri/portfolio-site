      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="project-blurb">
       Stefano Passeri is an Italian-born artist based in the Washington, D.C. 
       area. Using model-making, programming, digital fabrication, and simple 
       mechanics, his work foregrounds the fragility and humor embedded in 
       everyday technology. His projects reimagine monumental structures as 
       everyday materials—cardboard, foam, or off-the-shelf fixtures in place 
       of steel or stone—underscoring the relationship between permanence and 
       impermanence. His recent work focuses on the aesthetics of estrangement, 
       inviting technology to be seen less as spectacle than as a means of 
       defamiliarizing familiar structures.
        <br><br>
       Stefano holds an M.Arch with distinction from the Southern California 
       Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), where his thesis was awarded the 
       Frank O. Gehry Prize and the AIA Henry Adams Medal. He also holds a BA 
       in Fine Art and an MA in Philosophy from the University of London, 
       as well as a BSc from the Bartlett School of Architecture, University 
       College London.. He has taught architecture and digital media for more 
       than a decade at institutions including SCI-Arc and Rensselaer Polytechnic
       Institute. He is currently a faculty member in Art and Immersive Media Design 
       at the University of Maryland.
